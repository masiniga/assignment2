### 0. Requirements

I used Python version 3.10.4 to run my code.
I believe the following modules would be sufficient.
(Some of these were taken from the class github page.)
```bash
$ pip install spacy
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
$ pip install flask flask-restful flask-sqlalchemy
$ pip install mypy
$ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

### 2. Running
 
For the flask app, run the command below.

```bash
$ python app_flask.py
```
